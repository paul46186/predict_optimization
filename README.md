# USING PYTHON LIBRARIES TO PREDICT, OPTIMIZE, AND PROVIDE END USERS DECISION CONFIDENCE

Our work demonstrates a code design that integrates a trained predictive model using the python library PyCaret into an optimization model using Pyomo. Using a publicly available dataset we predict window breakage from manufacturing process settings. Then via the Pyomo AML optimize what the process settings should be to minimize breakage rate. What makes this case study useful to the audience is that decision-makers such as the manufacturing technician that must set the process settings often want to know how an outcome (e.g., window breakage) might change if the “optimal” settings are not used. Our Python code design shows how to efficiently integrate the predicted model into the optimized model and then show an outcome distribution based on how the user might want to change an input parameter. The Data Scientist to the Developer would find our example as a great use case to extend to their problem.
